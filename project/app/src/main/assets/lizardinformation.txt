Most lizards have dry, scaly skin. They have four legs, clawed feet, and a long tail. You can see their outside ear opening.

Lizards have a weak tail. A small bump or tug will break it off. This will puzzle the enemy. The lizard can get away. Not all lizards have weak tails.

Lizard tails help in balance and movement. Fat is stored in the tail. Losing the tail can be a big problem. Some lizards can grow a new tail.
