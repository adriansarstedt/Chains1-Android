Mosquitos are slender true flies, usually less than 1 cm long. They have long thin legs and wings. Some other true flies look like mosquitos, but only mosquitos have the long thin mouthparts called a proboscis. Adult mosquitos have long antennae, and male mosquitos antennae look very feathery. Like all true flies, mosquitos only have two wings. Their bodies and wings are covered with microscopic scales.
