Aggressive and unwary, the Common Raven is a ubiquitous habitat generalist. Throughout their range, they inhabit montane areas but may be found in virtually every type of forest, as well as among man-made structures. At 61cm, these birds are the largest of the passerines (perching birds). Characteristic traits include their long, wedge-shaped tails, long, powerful bills and thick, shaggy throat feathers. Their long, rounded wings extend nearly to the tips of their tails! While the sleek plumage of the adult is completely black, it has a bluish, iridescent sheen in the sunlight. Juvenile birds display gray-based neck feathers. On the fly, Common Ravens soar, flapping only occasionally (distinguishing them from crows that never soar).
