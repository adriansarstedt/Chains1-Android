 The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is valued for its bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and affectionate protective nature.

 Some of them can be quite vocal when happy, and some will smile by baring their front teeth in a peculiar grin - this is not a threat but a sign of joy or submissiveness.

Chesapeakes are naturally dominant and although they won't usually start a fight, they will defend their position as the alpha dog. Obedience training is a must with this breed.
