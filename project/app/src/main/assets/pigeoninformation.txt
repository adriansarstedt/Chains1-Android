Pigeon is a bird that lives in close proximity to humans for thousands of years. There are over 300 different species of pigeons that can be found throughout the world (except in the Sahara desert, on the Antarctica and Arctic). Greatest variety of pigeons exists in India, Malaysia, Asia and Australia. Pigeons inhabit woodlands, tropical rainforests, grasslands, savannas, mangrove, rocky areas and even deserts. These birds are often kept as pets because of their beauty and intelligence. Beside large number of pigeons in the wild, hundreds of thousand pigeons live in captivity. Some species of pigeons are endangered due to habitat loss, predation and diseases.
