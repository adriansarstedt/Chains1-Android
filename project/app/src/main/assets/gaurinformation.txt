The gaur is one of the larger of the wild cattle, and individuals can reach over two metres at the shoulder. The sleek, dark coat is black in mature males and dark brown in females and juveniles. The legs are light coloured and, unusually amongst cattle, there is a ridge of grey between the horns. These cattle are extremely heavyset and bulky; they have a large shoulder hump and a dewlap of skin under the chin reaching between the forelegs. Both sexes bear horns that are yellow with black tips; the horns leave at the side of the head and curve upwards.
