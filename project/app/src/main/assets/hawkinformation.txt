Of all the birds of prey, hawks are the most common. You might have heard their screeching, echoing call or seen them soaring high in the air. The red-tailed hawk is common in America. It has a reddish brown tail.

Hawks are fierce hunters. They have good eyesight and can see prey from high in the sky. They dive down to catch rabbits, mice, lizards or snakes. Sometimes they perch from a tree or telephone pole and swoop down after prey.
