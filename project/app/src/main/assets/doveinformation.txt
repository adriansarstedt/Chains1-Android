Domesticated doves and pigeons like human contact. They are quiet and peaceful, and make wonderful pets.

When pigeon breeds and doves take flight, they take off with a whirring sound. These breeds were noted early on for their flying behaviors which include aerial acrobatics as well as a homing instinct.

These birds can be quite entertaining as well as useful. Throughout history they have been used to carry messages, and were known as carrier pigeons. The homing instinct is still employed today.

The homing instinct is demonstrated today in the popular use of white pigeons for wedding releases. (Note: the birds used in Weddings are White Pigeons, not White doves. White Pigeons are a larger bird with a developed homing instinct that the White Dove lacks.) Itt has also influenced the popular sport of racing pigeons, or 'Pigeon Racing'.
